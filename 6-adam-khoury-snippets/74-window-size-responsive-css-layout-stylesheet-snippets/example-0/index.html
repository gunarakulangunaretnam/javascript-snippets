        It's important to remember that a NAMED LAYER is addressed differently than
        a NAMED INDIVIDUAL STYLE. With a NAMED LAYER, you do not have to use the
        CLASS Attribute at all. You only use the ID Attribute to address or insert the NAMED
        LAYER into an Element.
        Technically you don't have to use the CLASS Attribute of an Element, even
        when you are implementing a NAMED INDIVIDUAL STYLE; but in that case, you are
        circumnavigating the intention of the NAMED INDIVIDUAL STYLE so that it is only
        being used as a regular CLASS of STYLE instead of as an EXCEPTION to a CLASS of
        STYLE. This defeats its intended purpose, but there's nothing wrong with it.
        Note that the two different capitalizations of "Layer" and "LAYER" are only used
        for emphasis purposes and should be, in all circumstances, considered interchangeable.
        The only time that the spelling of "Layer" is critical is when using the "layers[i]" Array
        in JavaScript code.
