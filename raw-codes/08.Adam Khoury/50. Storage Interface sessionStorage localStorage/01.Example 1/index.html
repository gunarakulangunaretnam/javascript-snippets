    localStorage.setItem("username", "Joker");

    /*
    
    we have to work with localStorage when we want things to be remembered longer like when the user close the browser down or in other tabs.
    But we use sessionStorage for more short lives memory for just one browering session.
    If the user shout the browser down ,the sessionStorage data will automaticaly destroyed.
    And also sessionStorage data connot be accessed by in multiple broweing tabs.

    Methods and properties like setItem() all that can be used on both localStorage and sessionStorage.
